# Visualization Project
This project contains several files:

1. Folder containing the original data files we worked with.
2. Folder containing the data files used throughout the code – the merged data file, as well as additional database files after downloading records with missing values, etc.
3. Python file – contains the code for data preprocessing, saving the data to Excel tables, and creating visualizations. This code is divided into functions for user convenience, so each function has a meaningful name.
4. HTML file (Interactive Heatmap) – a file containing one of the interactive visualizations we created – an interactive heatmap.
5. Tableau file (map – rural-community settlements depending on population size, cluster, and religion) – contains another interactive visualization – an interactive map.
6. PDF file – the project report.
7. R file containing code for merging the tables written in SQL into an Excel file to create the visualizations.
